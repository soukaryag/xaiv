# XAIV: Group Decisions, Simplified

## About

Even in quarantine, choosing what to do with friends is close to impossible. If one person likes a restaurant, another does not and the friend group rotates around the same activities or locations, bored out of their minds. With our app, that problem would not exist.

XAIV essentially acts as a Tinder but for activities for when you cannot decide or do not know where to go. It allows you to make a secure profile using two-factor authentication and create a group with other users of the app. From there, you determine an activity, general region, and range to determine all the locations in the area that are available to visit. You can choose to swipe right if you like the location and left if you do not. As all the members make their choices anonymously, one location will be determined by consensus. 

Users will be able to post about this on their feed easily and even make comments to review their time and experience at the location. We also have a calendar feature so that users with many groups and sessions can keep track of their activities and where and when it will be taking place. With our app, decisions are made easier and quicker with a swipe of your finger.
